Generated Summary: The paper presents a novel approach to utilizing large-scale human video data to improve robotic dexterity and control. The authors propose a pre-processing pipeline for extracting human hand motion trajectories, followed by training a deep learning model that translates these movements into robot-compatible instructions. The reviewers recommend that the reviewers include additional experiments that provide a more comprehensive performance analysis.

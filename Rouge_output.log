You seem to be using the pipelines sequentially on GPU. In order to maximize efficiency please use a dataset
Your max_length is set to 150, but your input_length is only 122. Since this is a summarization task, where outputs shorter than the input are typically wanted, you might consider decreasing max_length manually, e.g. summarizer('...', max_length=61)
